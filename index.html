The speaker of these words is ambiguous, however, we are granted the insight at least that God sees these things and notices that they are good. From the beginning, it appears that God Himself has a concrete understanding or at the very least an idea of what makes something good, and whether or not something is good. He exercises this deliberately throughout Genesis 1, taking note of each thing that impresses upon him its goodness. However, God creates more than 6 things throughout Genesis 1, and the remaining objects are omitted from this declaration of good. On a moral spectrum, &quot;good&quot; is most commonly seen as a positive description, compared often against &quot;bad&quot;, and at times &quot;neutral.&quot; Given the more black-and-white nature of the description of &quot;good&quot; in Genesis, the omission raises an ambiguity. If these things are not declaratively &quot;good,&quot; then are they &quot;neutral&quot; or even &quot;bad?&quot; The most relevant omission to us is when humans are created and apparently omitted from the &quot;good.&quot; Simply put, why? Is it a comment on the possibly subpar nature of our form or creation, or a notice of something more intimate? It is possible that here, God sees the human capacity, the exceptional &quot;good&quot; juxtaposed with the deplorable &quot;bad.&quot; Regarding humanity, this omission is worrisome, but lends some understanding of &quot;good&quot; as perhaps relating to the capacity for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; that humans inherently have available to them. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a001" id="a001" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a>; and <tei-seg ana="#separation" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">God divided the light from the darkness</tei-seg>. <sup><tei-seg type="verse" xml:id="ch01v5" id="ch01v5" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">5</tei-seg></sup>And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. <tei-measure unit="days" n="1" data-origname="measure" data-processed="">And there was evening and there was morning, one day</tei-measure>.</tei-ab>

Sometimes He leaves it as is, such as when he makes the seas, and other times he turns it into the land, or the sky.

The writer makes a good point, as the text never states the race or ethnicity of God, but man was made in &quot;Our image.&quot; Noticing the plurality of the word, the writer interprets this as the human race as a whole, not just white people. White Americans can make the country better for Black Americans by imaging the inclusiveness of the creation story of man. All these points can further be stronger by remembering the first Christians were not white, so Christianity is not just for white people.

Specifically, &quot;good&quot; appears very deliberately throughout Genesis 1 to state what particular items are good. However, there are a few notable exceptions to this that pose an interesting threat, but depending on what this passage is trying to say, this issue may become a non-issue. Individually, is &quot;every thing&quot; that God made good? If so, then these omissions are not significant and there irrelevant. However, is &quot;every thing&quot; on the whole good, in spite of the potential bad that was created? This generates an extremely compelling narrative, fitting in to the notion of potential balance in the world with consideration to good and bad, but it also concretely shows that God created some things that were bad. Why would he do this? Given the importance of language and deliberate use of language throughout Genesis on the whole, this appears to be the case with the omission of &quot;good&quot; from these certain things, and this statement at the end appears to explore if these things that are not necessarily &quot;good&quot; are actually &quot;bad&quot; on the whole. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a009" id="a009" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a> <tei-measure unit="days" n="6" data-origname="measure" data-processed="">And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day</tei-measure>.</tei-ab></tei-div>

Instead of as in Genesis 1, where God speaks the universe into existence, here it is as if he walks upon the Earth like a man, constructing these creations with his hands. He acts in a very human manner here, almost as if he is a craftsman. On God, this makes him appear with more care and attention to his creation, as a creator concerned with the beauty and art of his craft, just as an artificer or master artisan might be. Yet, there is also the notion that this brings God closer to humans, and humans closer to God. Humans have the ability to create, and must toil with skill and energy to do so, yet they can still create nonetheless. In this sense, they are as God is, crafting the world and breathing life into metal and earth to suit their needs, though admittedly not quite on the level that God is portrayed to have done. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a011" id="a011" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a> and man became a living soul. <sup><tei-seg type="verse" xml:id="ch02v8" id="ch02v8" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">8</tei-seg></sup>And the LORD God <tei-seg ana="#farmer" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">planted</tei-seg> a garden eastward, in <tei-placename ref="#l_eden" data-origname="placeName" data-processed="">Eden</tei-placename>; and there He put the man whom He had formed. <sup><tei-seg type="verse" xml:id="ch02v9" id="ch02v9" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">9</tei-seg></sup>And <tei-seg ana="#creation" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">out of the ground made the LORD God <tei-seg ana="#food" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">to grow every <tei-seg ana="#good" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food</tei-seg></tei-seg>; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of <tei-seg ana="#good" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">good</tei-seg> and <tei-seg ana="#evil" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">evil</tei-seg></tei-seg><a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-content="<i class= &quot;small&quot;>Jason Prentice</i>: The translation of this term is consequential for how one understands the tree and also, perhaps, anything that has been labeled &quot;good&quot; thus far in Genesis.

More acutely obvious in Genesis 3 is how Eve takes direct interest in the tree, the only active actor in the scene with the serpent, where Adam is notably absent. This does much to characterize her inherent curiosity, which is instrumental in differentiating the two characters. Adam only does as directed by God, and what is made available to him, where Eve appears to more fundamentally realize her capabilities as a human. Yet she appears to be concerned with things other than gaining knowledge for herself, but perhaps in the potential of humans in the future, taking advantage of their skills of creation and free will.</tei-p>

If he created the tree, why tempt humanity? What does this add to the experience of living in Eden? Simply put, it is difficult to understand his motivations at this moment, because this leads to him having to apparently punish Adam and Eve when the disobey him. However, there is also the possibility that God did not create the Tree of Knowledge, or the serpent. God appears to be wary of the Tree, and of its inherent danger and apparent corruption. This creates the notion that perhaps he did not create it, as it was not intentional, and as such problematic for him as well as Adam and Eve. The serpent itself provides a unique presence in the Garden, and is often interpreted differently as Satan or a Spirit. Yet, God does appear to be able to exert his will over it, ensuring that it is a being less than divine. Overall, the presence of these things is definitively problematic, and poses an interesting crack in the paradise of Eden. -Mark M.</tei-p>"><tei-anchor xml:id="a015" id="a015" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a><a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-content="<i class= &quot;small&quot;>Hailey Grace Ames</i>: Last semester, I took a class called &quot;Ancient Worlds&quot; and we read Genesis.

If he is susceptible to shame, it follows that he is susceptible to anger, sadness, happiness, and the whole gamut human emotion.

Abel's murder is an incredibly morally black event that occurs as we understand it, and God reflects this, when he is suitably angry and curses Cain.  God wants to show Cain that what he did was wrong or at least inconvenient for him, and as such is dismayed when he fails the test of his basic loyalty and faith after murdering Abel and ultimately lying to God himself. The other potential explanation is that God did in fact, not know that Cain had killed Abel, or at least had not yet realized it. This means that God is merely a fallible observer with immense power, and colors his actions with genuine concern or interest. He does not know where Abel went, and that troubles him. The revelation that Cain had murdered him is a betrayal of the highest order for God's expectations, and He takes action in accordance with this anger. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a031" id="a031" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a><a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-content="<i class= &quot;small&quot;>Noah Chasen</i>: This is the second time that God has asked a question He already knew the answer to.

This means that humans can only accrue so much prestige and ability before invariably dying, their lifespan being concretely limited beyond their control by the divine. This is rather important, since it feeds into the notion that God has a specific idea for what humans should learn in their lives, and that their potential must be limited for one reason or another. This hard limit on human life is also indicative that God wants mankind to develop more slowly, possibly because he feels that humans need to learn certain things before pushing forward harder in both age and knowledge. Essentially, it appears that He wants to limit the ascension of mankind for a time. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a034" id="a034" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a></tei-seg> <sup><tei-seg type="verse" xml:id="ch06v4" id="ch06v4" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">4</tei-seg></sup><tei-seg ana="#combination" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">The <tei-persname ref="#nephilim" data-origname="persName" data-processed="">Nephilim</tei-persname> were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.</tei-seg></tei-ab>

Either way, he deems this development as highly questionable and even condemnable, and as a result prepares to flood the Earth.

This could be indicative a bias that God is not subject to- after all, he put Noah's wife before Noah's sons, suggesting a hierachy. The Patriach, followed by the Matriarch, then the offspring and their wives, repeating the formula of husband to wife. However, Noah elevates his sons, even in spite of God's own orders, putting his sons before his wife. This could be indicative of merely preferring to attend to his sons, but perhaps more significantly, associates Noah with subjugating women beneath men. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a041" id="a041" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a></tei-ab>

The Lord, upon smelling the sacrifice, realizes he was wrong and admits as much. At times, this scene is characterized as God lamenting over his prior actions, and ensuring that he never will do such a thing again. Given the earlier discussion on God feeling the full range of human emotions, as implied by humans eating from the Tree of Knowledge, we see an interesting situation here where God is potentially wracked with regret in this instance. Apparently, God can make mistakes, and this is instrumental in understanding his at times confusing relationship with mankind.

The mere visage of God is enough to grant humans the right to rule under the Covenant, and they are God's chosen. When mankind was created, they were allowed this degree of divinity by God himself, and this divinity is exercised through humans creating. However, this creation is exercised by humans as relating to the divine, but not necessarily an extension. With toledot, or generations, there is a theme of humanity continuing its lineage.

God does not give the humans an opportunity to learn or change here, but scatters them without warning and confounds their language so they may not communicate. In a sense, this is a total condemnation of cooperation for quite some time to come, putting an innate barrier between all of these different language and developing peoples. However, this may fit into the notion that God wants humanity to learn- in this case, how to cooperate in the face of exceptional adversity insofar as they may not be able to speak the language. It is equally possible or even likely that this was done simply to see what mankind would do if God put one of its greatest obstacles yet in the way, the language barrier. -Mark M."><tei-anchor xml:id="a047" id="a047" data-origname="anchor" data-empty="" data-processed=""><sup><i class="far fa-comment-alt light"></i><sup></sup></sup></tei-anchor></a> <sup><tei-seg type="verse" xml:id="ch11v8" id="ch11v8" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">8</tei-seg></sup><tei-seg ana="#separation" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">So the LORD scattered them abroad</tei-seg> from thence upon the <tei-seg ana="#personification" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">face of all the earth</tei-seg>; and they left off to build the city. <sup><tei-seg type="verse" xml:id="ch11v9" id="ch11v9" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">9</tei-seg></sup><tei-seg ana="#consequence" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">Therefore was the name of it called <tei-placename ref="#l_babel" data-origname="placeName" data-processed="">Babel</tei-placename></tei-seg>; <tei-seg ana="#separation" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did <tei-seg ana="#repetition" data-origname="seg" data-processed="">the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth</tei-seg></tei-seg>.</tei-ab>

The speaker of these words is ambiguous, however, we are granted the insight at least that God sees these things and notices that they are good. From the beginning, it appears that God Himself has a concrete understanding or at the very least an idea of what makes something good, and whether or not something is good. He exercises this deliberately throughout Genesis 1, taking note of each thing that impresses upon him its goodness. However, God creates more than 6 things throughout Genesis 1, and the remaining objects are omitted from this declaration of good. On a moral spectrum, "good" is most commonly seen as a positive description, compared often against "bad", and at times "neutral." Given the more black-and-white nature of the description of "good" in Genesis, the omission raises an ambiguity. If these things are not declaratively "good," then are they "neutral" or even "bad?" The most relevant omission to us is when humans are created and apparently omitted from the "good." Simply put, why? Is it a comment on the possibly subpar nature of our form or creation, or a notice of something more intimate? It is possible that here, God sees the human capacity, the exceptional "good" juxtaposed with the deplorable "bad." Regarding humanity, this omission is worrisome, but lends some understanding of "good" as perhaps relating to the capacity for "good" or "evil" that humans inherently have available to them. -Mark M.</span><span>(The phrase "It was good" is repeated 6 times throughout Genesis 1, referring to a handful of different creations that God wills into existence during the creation myth.
