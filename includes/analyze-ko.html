<span class="prompt-title">Woman in Genesis: Two-Dimensional or Critical?</span>
<span class="prompt-author">Kelley Orr</span>
<span class="prompt-section">As far back as society knows, traditional thinkers believe women belong at home to be mothers and wives, while feminist movements believe in the social liberation of women. But no matter how different these two groups think, they would most likely agree there has always been a sort of enmity between men and women, particularly when it comes to marriage and sex. Followers of the Bible credit these feelings to the book of Genesis, as they believe the punishments that resulted from Eve’s actions practically damned humanity. Finding her character anti-feminist and insignificant, most readers of the book of Genesis believe the whole text to be pro-men. Using Genesis as evidence, conservatives throughout history claim women must be subservient to men and support their husbands. Besides a longstanding societal norm, their reasoning combs various points in the text, starting with the creation story of men and women. A man, Adam, was God’s initial human creation. They say since Adam came first, women are consequently second-class citizens not only by literally coming second, but also since Eve was created from Adam’s rib. Likewise, Eve came from a lesser part of Adam and her creation was specifically for him as a “help meet” in 2:18. To exist, Eve needs Adam not only for a purpose, but also for a body, which is of seemingly less value than her counter’s. Additionally, Adam’s tasks on earth were to name animals and have dominion over land and sea, while Eve’s tasks are ordered by God in chapter 3:16: “thy desire shall be to thy husband.” According to these conservatives, this line means Eve’s purpose is to be with her husband, not to have her own life or self-meaning. And most significantly, these conservatives blame women for getting Adam kicked out of the Garden of Eden, an eternal paradise, for listening to the serpent. In their conclusions, Eve is not a feminist character and negatively represents women.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">Perhaps though, Eve is not anti-feminist; her actions on paper may not make her inferior to her partner. Hildegard von Bingen, a twelfth-century Christian mystic, argues woman coming from man’s rib was not the first instance of human creation; in chapter 1:27, upon God creating humans, he made both male and female simultaneously, “in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.” Not only was this the actual first mentioning of human creation, but man and woman could also actually be of the same body, in contrast to one coming from a piece of the other. In Bingen’s argument, if order of appearance matters to those who find the text sexist, this would make woman equal to man. As for Eve being the scapegoat for their expulsion, Phyllis Trible, a feminist biblical scholar and professor of sacred literature, argues Eve’s conversation with and consequences of the serpent illuminate her as “intelligent, informed and perceptive” (Trible 113). The serpent approached Eve without Adam and recognized a quality in Eve her partner did not have. In the Hebrew, Eve does not say she was “beguiled” by the serpent as most Christian translations say, but “uplifted” (Heb.: hishi'ani = lifted me).  This is a key difference in word choice, as “beguiled” makes her appear as an unintelligent and gullible woman tricked by Christian evil. The Hebrew, however, says “uplifted,” more likely making the reader believe Eve was not tricked, but aware and capable of larger thinking. By eating the fruit, Eve created all that we know now: civilization. Clothing, childbirthing, traditions, and complex relationships all came as a consequence of knowing both good and evil. Eve and Adam fashioned themselves in branches upon realizing their nudity; Eve now understands the pain of childbirth; we bury our dead in the ground for funerals, from dust we come and from dust we shall return; men and women fight each other and court multiple partners, rather than binding to the first person they see. A day does not go by where society is not participated in.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">All in all, the book of Genesis has been read as a pro-men piece of literature for thousands of years, but the text itself is not bigoted, it is how the reader interprets it. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, nineteenth-century American suffragist, along with other feminist biblical scholars, claims it is possible to read the text in a feminist manner. Stanton is credited with editing The Woman’s Bible, believing other translations to be patriarchal. This book was considered too radical for its time, but like Eve, she contributed to something bigger—the idea the text can be feminist. According to Bingen, the misogynistic argument that Adam is superior to Eve because he was created first can be countered by the fact he was made from dirt, while Eve was made from flesh. Eve was made from a body, which has complex cellular behavior, while Adam came from what God had: earth. Eve, in the climax of the story of the Garden of Eden, does not appear clueless in her interactions with the serpent, but she converses with it and acts independently. Trible notices Eve has the first dialogue ever and with a divine being. Consequently, Eve learns from the conversation and makes a decision from the information the serpent is telling her (Trible 113).</span>
<span class="prompt-section">But after Eve and Adam are expelled from the garden, the book continues on with less and less energy spent on women. Even after God places emphasis on the pain of childbirth, in chapter 5, not a single mother or wife is mentioned in the decades of endless genealogy. None of the women in Noah’s story have names, and when God tells Noah to exit the boat in a certain order, Noah has the women exit last. Clearly, Genesis does not place as much importance on female characters as on the male characters; they are secondary, weak, and unimportant as women. Nevertheless, is Genesis completely anti-women? It clearly can be read in a pro-woman way, but formally, is it pro-men? According to Stanton, if the text keeps being read unethically, equality in the modern world cannot be achieved (Kern 19). Women will still be seen as second-class citizens or incapable of anything a man can do. Words matter, and this text from hundreds of years ago can change the future. There are several instances worth looking into that can be read as pro-woman:
<ul>
<li>1:28 - God blesses both Adam and Eve, giving them both dominion over the earth and sea. The power does not just belong to Adam.</li>
<li>2:18 - God says it is not good for the man to be alone. He cannot be a human by himself.</li>
<li>3:3 - Eve quotes God to the serpent, saying how she is not supposed to eat the fruit. God never directly told her this, she internalized information versus having to hear it. </li>
<li>3:4 - Eve not only sees the fruit as food, a basic necessity, but as a source of pleasure, a luxury. She can see beyond what she needs and can seek what she wants.</li>
<li>3:6 - Adam and Eve fashion clothes as a result of eating the fruit. A trope of civilization is clothing, Eve starts creating society.</li>
<li>3:16-20 - Eve’s action creates civilization: farming, bread (a prepared food), culture through funerals (returning the dead back to the earth), and clothing.</li>
<li>3:24 - God sends Adam out of the garden explicitly, but not Eve.</li>
</ul>
