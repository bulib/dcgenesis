<span class="prompt-section-title">Introduction</span>
<span class="prompt-section">God’s relationship with humans on Earth is a difficult one to characterize, some stating that the motivations behind his actions are driven by a desire for forgiveness. Such a narrative is pushed in <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/rhetoricraceandreligion/2017/03/give-joseph-a-job.html">"Give Joseph a Job"</a>, an article by Reverend Derrick Holmes concerned with the narrative of forgiveness in Genesis. The people and by extension God call for forgiveness after Joseph is imprisoned for “sexual misconduct,” which he did not commit. That being said, his time in prison allowed him to share his gift of interpreting dreams with his fellow cell-mates, and when they were released, talk of his ability and the beauty of this gift spread to the pharaoh himself, who gives Joseph a chance. This gift eventually improves the quality of life of the people in Egypt, and Joseph becomes a more than effective member of society. The same message is shown even earlier in Genesis when Jacob and Esau reconcile, forgiving each other for past transgressions and being better for it, especially in the eyes of the God. This same notion of acceptance is one applied at large, that God wants us to forgive one another, which implies something else. God apparently attempts to ensure interaction between people in a more wholesome manner, leading to the impression that he does care about the quality of life that people lead, further showing potentially a serious investment in humans on some level. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">However, there is an alternative view concerning God’s actions. Some state that God is, in fact, not forgiving, but less emotionally invested in humanity. Instead, He cares more for showing mankind the way to live their lives properly, as a teacher. In essence, all of the actions God takes concerning the people in Genesis are to some end, meant to be a lesson. Leon Kass, a public intellectual who is intimately involved in discussions on Genesis, believes as much, portraying Adam and Eve’s respective curses in part as learning experiences for Adam and Eve. In essence, a mixed blessing, where they are forced to work the earth and endure pain and struggle, but in doing so are led to a deep and intimate love for each other and other humans, a notion Kass writes about at length in his book <i>The Beginning of Wisdom: Reading Genesis</i>. Here, God is presented as concerned with ensuring that humans develop from their experiences, in essence learning, consciously or not, about their role in the world and with other humans. In this situation, God in punishes, but leaves room for growth and learning, in this instance setting up the rest of humanity to learn from this point on about their new condition and role as mortals. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">Another view still is the view of God more as a detached observer and even experimenter instead of either of these. There is the notion that at times, God imposes his will on humans simply to see what will happen, or makes off-handed decisions to see what end it will reach. By the way of explanation, one might look at the story of Cain and Abel, where God offhandedly prefers Abel’s blessing to Cain’s, which invariably leads to a disruption in what he is observing—Cain kills Abel. Yet, God did leave room for doubt here, essentially offering Cain two choices, as Kass asserts, “Cain’s sacrifice was not rejected but merely not yet accepted… From Cain’s reaction it appears as though he understood God’s disregarding his sacrifice as a simple rejection” (Kass 137). Cain was given the opportunity to consider this action either way, and chose to perceive it as the most negative explanation, which later upsets God when he takes radical action—something God may not have anticipated. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">All of these different perspectives, simply put, are at odds and can be supported through different situations in Genesis. How can we know for certain which is correct? In order to understand in some measure what God’s motivations might be, we must closely look at some of the events where God takes significant action. Specifically:
<ul>
<li>The Expulsion from Eden—Adam, Eve, and the Serpent</li>
<li>Cain’s Curse—An Unfortunate Test</span>
<li>The Flood & Noah—Resetting the World—Why Noah?</li>
<li>Babel—Forgiveness?</li>
</ul>
</span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">Expulsion from Eden</span>
<span class="prompt-section">The expulsion from Eden is a text we looked at earlier in the introduction, and is important because both Adam and Eve disobeyed God, and as such God curses them in significant measure to radically change their reality. Adam is forced to work the earth, desire women, and take upon the burden of working to support the family. Eve on the other hand is forced to rely upon man and bear children, fulfilling an entirely different role, one which, in some measure opposes her original appearance in Genesis 3, given her initial curiosity and independence. Again, however this is not a fatal event, and these individuals can grow and change. Their different punishments also indicate a desire from God for them to change in some manner as well. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">For Adam, he was complacent as Eve picked from the tree and spoke with the serpent, this complacency fueled by a single-minded nature, potentially tainted by lust as Kass puts it. As such, his punishment is fitting, that he would sacrifice his role in Eden for his role by Eve’s side, his role in life would follow the same way. He would have to toil the Earth for sustenance for all of his days, and would ultimately return to the dirt that he relies upon. For failing to properly exercise his free will, God binds his will to the Earth and women. God caters his punishment to really demonstrate to the punished the nature of their folly, making it a punishment with a concrete lesson at the end—in a sense, rehabilitation. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">Eve’s punishment follows the same grain. For her curiosity and wayward nature, her independence is stripped away as she relies upon Adam for all she needs, and is forced to remain tied up in the efforts of raising children as the designated caretaker by God. This allows her to contemplate her actions, instead of subjecting herself to her curiosity and whims. Her punishment however, is not just physical from the pain of childbirth, but “psychic” as Kass describes it, her mandate leading to an incredible love for her children, and by association, their father. Overall, a punishment geared to make Eve learn from her folly. But also, why not a more significant punishment? Eve essentially ruined the very notion of Eden for as far as the readers know, the only two humans to be alive. This may be because God describes the punishment for eating from the Tree of Knowledge as dying, which He may realize was not Eve’s fault, since “‘Dying means nothing to someone if they have never seen it before” (Hailey A, Gen. 3:4-6). Eve is an eager novice in the world, and God appears to understand that in some capacity, and as such feels that she must be disciplined, but definitely forgiven. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">However, the serpent is an exception to this idea of learning from one’s lessons, and provides more evidence for a God concerned with trimming down errant variables that irritate the nature of his observations. The serpent is essentially reduced to a shadow of its former self, forced to slither upon the ground and stripped of its ability to speak. In essence, it cannot go any higher. Perhaps even more likely still is that God was so frustrated by the upsetting of his designs for loving and wholesome humans, he took vengeful action on the snake to relieve some of this frustration. In a sense, the serpent’s punishment apparently deviates from the picture we thought we had established in this episode, raising more questions. As Aidan S. notes, “the order of judgement flows from the causal chain of deception” (annotated on Gen. 1:14). In a sense, this is God imposing morality into his decisions on punishment, showing that for the greatest deception, the snake cannot learn, or further still, cannot be forgiven, complicating the narrative of forgiveness or education. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">Moreover, we can explore God’s emotional state or investment in the happenings of humanity when he says, “Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil,” yet right after eating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, they noticed that they were naked and became ashamed. By the account given from God, this is the first thing they notice when they become like Him, which reflects back on God. As annotated in Genesis 3 verse 7, “If he is susceptible to shame, it follows that he is susceptible to anger, sadness, and happiness, and the entire gamut of human emotion” (Mark M.). If God is emotionally invested in this world, and has an understanding of good and evil similar to our perception of it, then the notion of God as a forgiving caretaker holds more weight, complicating the slightly more emotionally detached teacher perspective. </span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">Cain’s Curse</span>
<span class="prompt-section">As discussed before, Cain was given a choice and left to his own devices, though it was not necessarily framed as a test from the divine, but a preference, the murder of Abel an unfortunate side-effect. However, later, God does present Cain with something more akin to a test, standing up as more of the educator picture when he asks Cain, “‘Where is Abel thy brother’ and he said: ‘I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen. 4:9). Annotated in Genesis 4:9, it is noted, “When God offers to let Cain come clean for his actions or possibly even to lament on what he had done, Cain fails God completely” (Mark M.). This colors the entirety of their interaction afterwards as sympathetic towards God, who was met with some measure of scorn for asking, leading into the ultimate punishment for Cain’s failure. If God does not know about Abel’s whereabouts, “The revelation that Cain had murdered him is a betrayal of the highest order for God's expectations, and He takes action in accordance with this anger.” (Mark M, Gen. 4:9). God hasn’t experienced willful betrayal up until this point, merely disobedience, so this would be an opportunity for massive development for God. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">The episode of Cain and Abel is defined by the curse God puts on Cain, tinting the entirety of the interaction. As stated before, God apparently gave Cain a choice, and as far as we can tell, Cain chose incorrectly. As such God’s hand is forced to take action. Cain is cursed with as far as we can understand, immortality, the hurts done upon him reflected on those who do them, and he is cut loose by God to suffer, since he can no longer till the earth and return to being a farmer. Yet, as Kass observes, “Farming requires intellectual sophistication and psychic discipline” (Kass, 130). Cain is given another choice here—does he fulfill his mandate by God, wander the earth, and perhaps at times be fruitful and multiply? </span>
<span class="prompt-section">The answer here is potentially a strong negative—Cain does indeed have children, and as far as we can tell wander in some measure, but something more important is that he raises the first cities. Cain raises civilization through his lineage and potentially his presence in the background, his descendants creating music, art, tools, and eventually, weapons of war. Cain’s story for us begins with violence, and ultimately breeds violence in major capacity. There is “a very intimate association with evil and civilization” (Mark A, Gen 4:19-22). It appears that throughout Genesis 4, God sets up opportunities for Cain to become better, but he begets evil in his actions and ultimately even in his descendants. The consequences of this are demonstrated later, when God decides to wipe the slate clean, ultimately because of Cain’s complete failure.  </span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">The Flood &amp; Noah</span>
<span class="prompt-section">The Flood is in a sense the continuation of Cain’s legacy, where God takes his final action to end Cain’s destructive legacy as mankind is found to be corruptive upon the Earth. In a sense, God here is the frustrated experimenter, who wants to restart the experiment from the beginning to get better—perhaps less self-destructive—results. Violence for the experimenter is just inherently inconvenient, since it definitively closes paths to Him, but in this instance, we see God himself resort to violence. He floods the Earth, cleansing it of life in the ultimate act of violence. He chooses to save Noah, his ideal guinea pig in a sense replicating the conditions after Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden. Again, a fresh start, where Noah appears to be the non-violent, growing figure that God very much needs. Noah’s survival also may be the only saving grace for the forgiveness narrative in this regard, particularly because God does not destroy all of humanity—he forgives it enough to save it, perhaps because of some doubt about the nature of man in the back of his mind.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">However, something occurs in the wake of the Flood that breaks this notion of the experimenter starting over. Noah makes a sacrifice to God, but not one of plants, but of meat described as “sweet savor” in the translation we used. This is a sacrifice inherently derived from violence at the altar, the reason why God cleansed the Earth in the first place. As a result, he laments after the sacrifice, pledging himself to never again take such action, but showing a very emotional side of God. He exhibits regret, and ultimately, this is not what the apathetic experimenter would do. He is apparently invested in what goes on in the lives of humankind, and he realizes ultimately that he has made a mistake in his assumptions. Perhaps this is the frustration of an experiment gone wrong, and a lament accordingly—or the realization of a God who now sees forgiveness as the only truly “good” way to help these people. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">A detail just before the flood is that of God limiting mankind’s lifespan to a mere 120 years, a shadow of the lifespans shown before throughout Genesis. This event appears to be strange, however, it can be explained. When he does this, “God wants mankind to develop more slowly” (Mark M, Gen. 6:3). This detail supports the notion of the more didactic God. There is a reason that God limits mankind’s lifespan, and it is quite possible that it is because God wants to change the chain of human development. As it has happened thus far, God has seen humanity use its extended age to raise cities and incite conflict, so it is possible this acts as a stop gap measure by God to stem the conflict within humanity. </span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">Babel</span>
<span class="prompt-section">The punishment for the people of Babel is a scattering and the confounding of their language by God himself, a punishment for their wayward nature, and we see a return to the more forgiving or didactic God. While he does not attempt to explain himself to the humans or interact with them, he does not kill them. He merely sets them back, and in a manner that they can rectify with cooperation. Overall, God does not ruin the people of Babel, but through their punishment makes them consider what may have just occurred, since it was so obviously from the divine, and why. On the same token, God forgives them, allowing them to prosper in their different corners on smaller levels. Especially considering how their motivation for building the tower—for glory—can evoke the age of the Nephilim before the Flood for God, this action must have taken great restraint to not potentially strike down humanity more completely. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">However, the nature of what God does is still partially ambiguous here. Why does he confound mankind’s language in particular? The idea that God may have done this to “put one of its (humanity’s) greatest obstacles yet in the way, the language barrier” (Mark M, Gen. 11:6-7). This may, instead of being seen as a concerned God exercising restraint in scattering humanity, instead be seen as God wanting to see what mankind will do when faced with this newest challenge. Language is the most wild variable to challenge humanity at this point, and may be the most interesting thing for God to have thought to test. 	</span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">Conclusion</span>
<span class="prompt-section">In the end, Genesis presents a God who has many facets, sometimes standing in contradiction, and at other times in unity. At times, God appears to care deeply for the people in front of them, emotionally invested in exactly what happens each step along the way and experiencing a wide range of emotion to govern his future decisions. In equal measure, we see instances of God acting in such a manner befitting that of the scientist trying to get results, though of what we cannot tell. Even still, He could be attempting to teach humans of their mistakes, and ultimately show them the best way to realize their folly. In the end, God is clearly a motivated being, yet the nature of this motivation is ambiguous, yet can be explored throughout Genesis. As such, the driving question behind every event in Genesis,  and what each might mean or be going towards: What motivates God?
