<span class="prompt-title">Genesis: The Snake, The Woman and the Tree</span>
<span class="prompt-author">Joshua Isak</span>
<span class="prompt-section">A number of questions, inconsistencies and discrepancies arise when putting Genesis under a literary microscope. One such case is that of the serpent in Genesis 3. Unlike all other animals in Genesis, only the serpent is able to speak. Moreover, it seems to use its ability to do so in a malicious manner. All other animals in Genesis are unthinking and mute actors, and seem to play no major role besides simply being present. The serpent however, is described as “the most cunning” beast of the field. This clear distinction between the serpent and all other animals raises questions about what kind of animal it is, or if it really is one at all. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">Foremost it is important to consider the questions raised by the serpent’s mere existence in the Garden of Eden, a place that given the use of the term garden is a paradise for God to cultivate his creations. The serpent seems to exist only as a mal actor that has it in for humans, and so raises the question of why God created the snake to begin with. To get the discrepancy that God created something that directly influenced the fall of man, Christian tradition describes the snake as the manifestation of Satan. Martin Luther, prominent Protestant and author of the Ninety-Five Theses, articulates that while God did not create the snake to be Satan, it was in fact a real one that was possessed by Satan to negatively influence Eve. It is important to note, however, that University of Chicago Professor Leon Kass points out there is no mention of the devil in the Tanakh until Zechariah 3:1 (see Gen. 3:3, Prentice annotation). Thus the idea of the serpent being Satan is a Christian idea applied as a contemporary interpretation of a more ancient Jewish text.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">Some interpretations of the text do not see the serpent as an animal at all. Given the way in which Eve interacts with the snake (through second guessing the word of God) some interpretations describe the snake as a manifestation of Eve’s inner nature. This is described in a number of ways. One possibility is that the snake represents Eve’s own reason. The way in which Eve and the snake interact is by asking questions of the word of God regarding his instructions on dealing with the Tree of Knowledge, and ultimately deciding that the fruit is “good to eat.” This kind of back and forth and ultimate decision evokes a conversation one might have with themselves when faced with a decision. In other words, the snake represents Eve talking herself into eating from the Tree of Knowledge. To further this, the mere act of reaching for the fruit essentially means that she has already tasted it. As Kass states, “the woman, before she eats of it, has already made a judgement that the tree is good for food and a delight to the eyes.” Kass goes on to state that it was Eve’s own “autonomous knowing of good and bad” that led to her decision of what to do with the fruit. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">Another interpretation for this not-actually-a-serpent serpent is the idea that it is a manifestation of humanity’s own sexual desire. As Kass states in Chapter 2 of <i>The Beginning of Wisdom</i>: </span>
<div class="prompt-section-quote">Some treat the serpent as raw (or insidious) male power (a phallic symbol); they see here a tale of the sexual seduction of woman. Others, on the contrary, treat the serpent as fundamentally feminine, as serpents are in many ancient myths—they belong to the earth, and they possess what was regarded as a female power of rebirth and self-renewal… </div>
<span class="prompt-section">A prominent theme throughout Genesis is the idea of Toledot or generations. This is in regards specifically to human reproduction as making more of ourselves is inherent to our survival, and Genesis understands this. In Genesis 1, the command God gives to humans after they are created is to “be fruitful and multiply,” the same given to Noah after the flood. God wants humans to flourish, but in Genesis 2 the idea of needing to reproduce is not present until after Eve eats from the Tree of Knowledge. In doing so and receiving the punishment from God, Adam and Eve finally get wind of the idea of Toledot, and when they are banished from the garden they start reproducing with children of their own.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">While there are a number of ways to view the serpent in Genesis, the existence of the Tree of Knowledge remains inherently problematic. When God creates humans in Genesis 1, he tells them that they may eat from any fruit bearing tree of the garden. Genesis 2 seems to retcon this and tells them that they are forbidden from eating from the Tree of Knowledge. This raises two important questions. First, why is this command retconned in the next chapter? Second, why create a tree that humans are forbidden from eating from in the first place? Several explanations can exist for the retconning of the fruit permissions, and the simplest answer is that the book of Genesis is a collection of unrelated but similar scrolls bound together into a single narrative. This idea is known as the Documentary Hypothesis. A good source for further reading is <i>Renewing the Documentary Hypothesis</i>, by Joel S. Baden. Yet even this still raises the questions about why that particular inconsistency was left in, even if this does not make this instance a retcon. </span>
<span class="prompt-section">The creation of the Tree of Knowledge presents greater issues however. Canonically, the tree bears fruit that when eaten gives humans knowledge of good and evil. The foremost manifestation of this knowledge is Adam and Eve feeling shame for their nudity, and fashioning loincloths for themselves. This action ultimately reveals to God that they have eaten the fruit. Given the nature of what the fruit does to humans, and the fact that the only thing stopping humans from eating the fruit is God’s own warning, it seems as though the tree of knowledge exists as a test for humans. They are to either wholly obey God’s word and not eat the fruit, or they are to eat from it and be cursed with knowledge of good and evil, only complicating their lives with knowledge of things like shame, and of course ultimately receiving mortality and banishment from the Garden of Eden. As Kass argues, this could be a representation of humanity’s own rise to maturity, and eating from the Tree was our way of gaining independence and leaving the confines of Eden.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">Ultimately, when examined literally, the story of Adam and Eve’s disobedience seems to expose inconsistencies and mistakes on behalf of the writers of Genesis. With a deeper analysis however, many possibilities and interpretations reveal themselves, each saying more about humanity’s creation, growth, and desires.</span>
