<span class="prompt-title">Humanity and Divinity: Mankind’s Relationship to God</span>
<span class="prompt-author">Noah Chasen</span>
<span class="prompt-section">The first creation story in Genesis introduces readers to the Israelite God, whose first words, "Let there be light" (1.3), are immediately obeyed by the universe around Him. Given this display of power as well as His influence over the rest of Genesis, God is shown to be a powerful being beyond the limitations of humanity. Through the rest of Genesis, God exerts His will over the world in other ways than creation, such as causing a great flood that covers the earth (7.3), "rain[ing] upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire … out of heaven" (19.24), and granting the ninety-year-old Sarah fertility to have Isaac (21.2).</span>
<span class="prompt-section">These actions are reason enough to believe that God and His command over the world is beyond human capabilities since no single mortal can truthfully claim to achieve the same miracles as Him. However, a problematic sentence contained in the final days of creation in Genesis 1 may contradict this understanding. After God spends his sixth day of creation bringing forth creatures of the earth, he speaks humanity into existence with the words “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (1.26). In this moment, a connection between humans and God is formed that opposes the belief that God and His actions are somehow beyond human limitations. If humans are made in the image and likeness of God, then the nature of God is intrinsically linked to the nature of humanity.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">How then can this relationship between God and humans be defined? The idea of a parent-child relationship between God and humanity is common, with faiths such as Christianity using terminology such as “Heavenly Father” to refer to God. In Genesis, this relationship can be seen in God’s praise to the faithful and punishment of those who would defy him. For example, in Genesis 6, Noah is one of the few humans to find “grace in the eyes of the LORD” (6.8) during a time when “the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (6.5). This idea of humanity’s imperfection in the eyes of God and his use of certain faithful, favorable humans to improve the world in His image is reminiscent of a parent seeing undesirable behaviors in a child and wiping them out while promoting better behaviors, like removing violence in favor of manners.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">If this relationship theory is to be developed further, a question that will arise is one of humanity’s development and maturation. If humanity is the spawn of God, in His image, then what is the dynamic as humanity grows and learns and improves itself? One interesting example of this relationship in action is when Abraham is able to dissuade God from destroying the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah should he be able to find ten good people in the city (18.33). Much like how a parent can listen to and learn from their child, God is able to listen to what Abraham is requesting and acquiesce to his request. This behavior indicates that God does have respect for humanity and their agency in the world, especially if a human can change the mind of such a powerful entity such as God.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">Since people can challenge God and successfully influence His thinking, could Abraham’s exchange with God regarding Sodom and Gomorrah be a demonstration of humanity’s strength or of God’s weakness? Alternatively, is there any reason to include such a divide between the God and mankind, or is the relationship between the two more communal and cooperative than competitive? As God tells humanity after their creation in Genesis 1, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth” (1.28). His command indicates that God created humans as caretakers of His creations, to hold power over the earth and all that inhabits it, much like how a parent would give their child control over aspects of their lives to teach them responsibility, harkening back to the view of the relationship between God and humanity being akin to that of a parent and child.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">This line of questions and observations leads to one of the most important problems in Genesis: what is the phrase “in our image, after our likeness” meant to convey about the relationship between humans and God? Answering this question is important because it can give insight into the nature of God and why He created humans with their potential to disobey His commandments. Answering this question could require a search of Genesis for moments where God gives humanity responsibility and seeing how their actions disappoint or please God.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">Before this topic can be broached, however, the usage of the pronoun “our” in the phrase “in our image, after our likeness” must be addressed. Seemingly, this implied plurality indicates that God is not alone as a powerful being. Much discussion has been had between members of this class about later usage of plural pronouns in reference to God and His ilk, including questions about if “the only step between them [humans] and godliness” (Mark M.) was eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Some scholars may say that although God appears to be addressing multiple people, perhaps other gods, in this quote, He still “created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them” (1.27). Emphasized in this quote are the single, masculine, pronouns of God, indicating that His acknowledgement of others in his creation of humans in “our image” did not change the fact that one God appeared to spawn humanity in His image. This line, however, still leaves troubling implications as to who else God could be speaking to, but a satisfying, provable answer is difficult to produce.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">An example of God giving people responsibility is with Noah and the ark. God enters a covenant with Noah stating that He will give him the instructions to construct the ark so that Noah may save his family and all beasts of the world before God covers the world in a flood to wipe out the evils of man. God, upon recognizing this wickedness, grieves, appearing disappointed in the failure of his creations to meet his standards and expectations. Noah, after being told what to do, follows God’s instructions, either out of fear to disobey God or out of true devotion, and enters the ark with two of every animal and his family. He is given the responsibility of saving life from the flood to prove that he can be better than the people who perished by God’s flood, and when God remembers Noah (8.1), He remembers Noah’s fulfillment of the covenant and how he and humanity could improve from the humans who were killed by the flood. As such, God is able to tell Noah that He “will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake … neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done” (8.21). He recognizes Noah’s accomplishment in saving humanity and vows to give humanity the respect and responsibility of not having God’s willingness to reset humanity back to one family and every animal.</span>
<span class="prompt-section">To further examine Genesis for examples of humanity’s power compared to God, we would need to address examples such as how God’s creation of the universe is depicted in Genesis 2 as detailed and akin to a gardener (2.8). Another example would be how Eve conceives Cain and says, “I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD” (4.1). These examples could lead people to speculate that there is not a source of contention between humanity and God, but rather a cooperative and codependent relationship between God and humans in the creation and maintenance of the universe.</span>
