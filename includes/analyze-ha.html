<span class="prompt-section-title">Introduction</span>
<span class="prompt-section">To look deeper into the text of Genesis, we must keep our eyes open to the book’s inconsistencies in its 
    portrayals. Through in-depth analysis, we discovered a few times where the text leaves out or incorporates 
    specific details that may go unnoticed. Upon closer dissection, these details lead to huge questions, 
    specifically when G-d names his creations “good” throughout the first chapter of Genesis.</span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">What Does G-d Label Good?</span>
<span class="prompt-section">After G-d produces His creations in Genesis 1, He deems it good immediately after. For example, 
    on the first day, He creates light from darkness and sees that “it was good” (Gen 1.4). He also names land, 
    sea, celestial bodies, and animals, both aquatic and terrestrial, good (Gen 1.12; 1.18; 1.22; 1.25). 
    However, G-d does not specifically distinguish three of His creations as good. He does not call darkness, 
    the firmament/heaven, or humans good (Gen 1.4; 1.7-8; 1.26-28) (refer to annotation “good” in 
    Chapter 1 by Mark M.). At first glance, this pattern may not seem compelling because at the end of 
    creation G-d “saw everything He had made, and, behold, it was very good,” but why did the text omit the 
    description originally (Gen 1.31) (refer to two annotations beginning with “And God saw everything He had 
    made” by Mark M. and Hailey A.)? This is not the only time where the text leaves out or inserts small elements. 
    Many instances occur where it is impossible to deny such consequential detail.</span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">The Number 7</span>
<span class="prompt-section">In his mid-twentieth century book titled <i>A Commentary on the Book of Genesis</i>, Umberto Cassuto, an Italian Rabbi, 
    he discusses how the text features the number seven many times in several different ways. As is commonly known 
    among Abrahamic religionists, G-d created the world in seven days, however, more subliminally, the first chapter 
    features many more sevens than previously thought. Umberto points out that in Chapter 1 of Genesis, G-d creates 
    the universe in seven paragraphs, the first paragraph has seven sentences, and in the original Hebrew, there are 
    seven words in the first sentence, and the word in the middle of the first sentence has seven letters. 
    Furthermore, he found the phrase “it was good” six times with the seventh time being “very good” and many 
    words appear in multiples of seven, such as G-d, light, water, and beasts</span>
<span class="prompt-section">It is well known that seven is a holy, complete number to the Abrahamic religions, and featured many more 
    times in the text, such as with the plagues later on in Genesis, and in festivals celebrated by Jews, Muslims,
    and Christians. Search for the motif of seven in the text to find instances in the first fifteen chapters. 
    This pattern cannot be coincidental. The writer(s) of the Book of Genesis purposefully took a symbol known by 
    its original intended audience and embedded it into the text in subtle ways, ways one might not notice when 
    not reading the book carefully or reading it in translation. However, we cannot look over the writer’s purposeful 
    integration of this level of care or specificity into the text. Nothing is too minuscule to be significant, 
    including the patterns of seven and more. For example, details in genealogies should be looked at closely, 
    since the text carefully spends time describing them, too.</span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">Who Are Sarai/Sarah’s Parents?</span>
<span class="prompt-section">The text does not explain Sarai/Sarah’s parentage for many chapters after her introduction, despite her being 
    the first woman in the covenant. Furthermore, the reader knows the parents of Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah 
    immediately when the women enter (Gen 24.15; 29.16). Genesis 11:29 introduces Sarai alongside Nahor’s wife, 
    Milcah, as, “Abram's wife...Sarai; and...Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, 
    and the father of Iscah” (refer to annotation beginning with "And Abram and Nahor took them wives” by Hailey A.). 
    There is a clear distinction in how the text presents these women. Milcah not only has her father announced 
    twice but also her brother. Mentioning her family is not odd, as many of the genealogies are similar. Any other 
    time a new character is introduced, who they are related to is also mentioned, relevant or not. However, the text 
    features nothing about Sarai’s family at all. In fact, the only thing we know about Sarai at this point is that
     she is married to Abram and that she has no children. It is not until later in the story that we hear about to
    whom she is related.</span>
    <span class="prompt-section">In Genesis 20, Abraham travels to Gerar with his wife after saving Lot from Sodom and comes face to face with a 
    familiar situation when Abimelech, the king, takes Sarah after Abraham tells him that she is his sister. Since 
    this happens after the covenant, G-d has sworn to Abraham that it will be with Sarah that a nation will be born, 
    so He goes to Abimelech in a dream to threaten him. The king then confronts Abraham about why he lied about 
    Sarah’s relation to him. Abraham says, after explaining that he was worried the men of Gerar would kill him if 
    they found out Sarah was his wife, “she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of 
    my mother; and so she became my wife” (refer to the annotation “She is my sister”  by Hailey A.). Abraham admits 
    to Sarah being his half-sister, so he was not technically lying when, in this instance and the one prior when he 
    tells the Pharaoh that she was his sister (Gen 12.10-20). She is. Sarah is Abraham’s half-sister on his father’s 
    side. The text buried this information. It is possible the writers purposefully hid Sarah’s father from the eye 
    of readers because in Leviticus incest is expressly prohibited, including between half-siblings (King James 
    Version, Lev 18.9) And since the majority of Biblical scholars agree that the Five Books of Moses (Genesis, 
    Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) were written all around the 6th century BCE, during the Babylonian 
    banishment, the writers had to have realized that the relationship between Sarai/Sarah and Abram/Abraham was 
    incongruent with Biblical law.</span>
<span class="prompt-section-title">Why Does This Matter?</span>
<span class="prompt-section">Besides leaving out an illegal marriage, the text presents more problematic things, such as what we already 
    mentioned: darkness, heaven, and humans not labelled good. It is intriguing that G-d did not look at darkness, 
    the firmament, and humans and call them good after their conception, like all His other creations. This
     inconsistency is especially curious after looking at why the details are important, such as with the 
     situation with Sarai/Sarah. In her case, the text may have omitted her parents because Sarai/Sarah’s 
     relationship with Abram/Abraham is technically against G-d’s rules. This kind of discrepancy poses many 
     questions. Are humans, heaven, and darkness evil, if they are not good? From a Christian perspective, 
     if G-d resides in heaven, why is heaven not labeled good (King James Version, Matthew 6.9)? Why would G-d 
     create things that are not good? What are his plans or motives in creating these three things? Perhaps most 
     strikingly, if G-d made humans in His image, is G-d not inherently good?</span>
     <span class="prompt-section">It is valuable to consider these questions when reading the text because, depending on how we understand the 
    Book of Genesis, we can interpret the text differently. By asking these kinds of questions, one is opening up 
    various interpretations that date back to when the writer(s) originally wrote this text. With this in mind, 
    another close reading of the book, supportive evidence from outside sources, such as information on the 
    documentary theory, and our interpretations may help us answer some of the questions we have moving forward.</span>
