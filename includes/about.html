<h3>What This Is</h3>

  <p>This website is the beginning of a digital scholarly edition of The Book of Genesis, created by participants in an undergraduate <a href="http://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a> <a href="http://bu.edu/core/">Core Curriculum</a> seminar titled “Digital Core: Genesis,” which took place during the Spring 2019 semester. This course builds on the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/core/academics/core-reading-list/">Core Reading List</a>, affording students a deep dive into a particular text on that list and the opportunity to remediate it in a way that furthers the engagement of peers who may be encountering it for the first time in an academic context.</p>
  <p>We (the instructors) chose semantic encoding in XML, collaborative annotation, and, of course, discussion as our tools for close reading. Students began by collaboratively annotating the text using MIT’s <a href="http://annotationstudio.org/">Annotation Studio</a> platform. We then introduced them to the basic syntax rules of Extensible Markup Language, as well as basic principles and problems of scholarly editing, both digital and analog. Students then collaboratively, iteratively encoded the first fifteen chapters of Genesis in XML, using the XML editing software <a href="http://oxygenxml.com/">Oxygen</a> (licenses for which were generously donated by SyncRO Soft SRL). </p>
  <p>Decisions about what to encode were made throughout the encoding process, emerging from students’ direct engagement with the primary text and with a small but varied collection of secondary writings. Thus, from the beginning — and throughout most of the encoding process — we did not use a best-practice encoding schema. We chose this approach in order to avoid the intellectual constraints of predefined categories, with the goal of fostering more direct, unmediated contact between the student readers and text. After encoding was more or less complete, the instructors, guided by invaluable help from Northeastern University’s <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/about/library-staff-directory/sarah-connell">Sarah Connell</a>, converted the encoding into <a href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">TEI P5</a>, an extensive modular encoding schema in wide use by literary text encoding projects.</p>
  <p>This site represents the beginning of a complete, student-driven digital edition of Genesis. The primary intended audience is future Core Curriculum students, as well as any other college students and instructors of the text. Work on this project will continue with a new cohort of participants in Fall 2019. When the site changes significantly, this page will be edited to reflect that.</p>

	<h3>The Translation</h3>

  <p>The translation of Genesis used on this site is from the <a href="https://jps.org/books/holy-scriptures-tanakh-1917-edition/">1917 Jewish Publication Society translation of the Tanakh or Jewish Bible</a>. Based on the Masoretic text (a medieval edition of the Hebrew scriptures, created by Talmudic scholars throughout the diaspora and, to this day, considered the authoritative Jewish text), the JPS 1917 edition closely follows the late-nineteenth-century Protestant Revised Version, itself a lightly revised version of the 1611 King James translation. Though the language is at times archaic, it is relatively faithful to the original Hebrew. That quality, combined with the fact that the translation is in the Public Domain, made it the clear choice for our project.</p>
    
	<h3>How to Interact with the Text</h3>

  <p>This site is best viewed using Firefox or Chrome. Other browsers may have problems. If you encounter issues with the site, we would appreciate a note to prentice-at-bu-edu and vzafrin-bu-edu specifying your operating system, the browser you are using, and the nature of the problem.</p>

  <p>Site features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hovering over most proper names will produce a popup with information about that entity. The encoding of proper names is minimal thus far: the name and, for persons, perhaps dates of birth and death (relative to the timeline used in Genesis, with creation beginning year 0). In future iterations of the site we plan to add more information about people and places.</li>
    <li>Comment icons within the text indicate annotations. Hovering over these icons will reveal corresponding notes, each of which is attributed to one or more project editors. To narrow down the displayed annotations to those of a specific editor, choose the editor’s name from the Notes Filter on the right above the text.</li>
    <li>Click Analyze to show a pane of student-written problem-question statements. Intended to highlight important interpretive problems and questions, these statements do not provide answers, but rather aim to deepen the reader’s engagement with the themes and other features of the Genesis, pointing to parts of the text that may be useful for further exploration. Each problem-question statement is complemented by a set of annotations (described above) that were created by the statement’s author in order to further address issues raised by the statement. To close this pane, click Analyze again, or click the X in the upper right corner of the Analyze pane.</li>
    <li>Click Reveal to show a pane that allows you to highlight semantic encoding elements of the text. Click any heading to expand it, then click an encoding element to choose how you would like to view it — highlighted, as colored text, bold, italic, etc. For each element, you may toggle this formatting on and off, allowing you to search for more than one encoded element at a time. You can clear all formatting via a link under the Reveal heading.</li>
  </ul>
