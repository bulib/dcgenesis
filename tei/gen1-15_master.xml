                <note target="#a001" resp="#mm">The phrase "It was good" is repeated 6 times throughout Genesis 1, referring to a handful of different creations that God wills into existence during the creation myth. The speaker of these words is ambiguous, however, we are granted the insight at least that God sees these things and notices that they are good. From the beginning, it appears that God Himself has a concrete understanding or at the very least an idea of what makes something good, and whether or not something is good. He exercises this deliberately throughout Genesis 1, taking note of each thing that impresses upon him its goodness. However, God creates more than 6 things throughout Genesis 1, and the remaining objects are omitted from this declaration of good. On a moral spectrum, "good" is most commonly seen as a positive description, compared often against "bad", and at times "neutral." Given the more black-and-white nature of the description of "good" in Genesis, the omission raises an ambiguity. If these things are not declaratively "good," then are they "neutral" or even "bad?" The most relevant omission to us is when humans are created and apparently omitted from the "good." Simply put, why? Is it a comment on the possibly subpar nature of our form or creation, or a notice of something more intimate? It is possible that here, God sees the human capacity, the exceptional "good" juxtaposed with the deplorable "bad." Regarding humanity, this omission is worrisome, but lends some understanding of "good" as perhaps relating to the capacity for "good" or "evil" that humans inherently have available to them. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a002" resp="#ha">This verse along with verse 9 is curious because it is difficult to imagine what pre-existence looked like. With the description we have available to us, it seems like the universe is a congealed mass of water that contains G-d, and as time progresses, He seperates the water. Sometimes He leaves it as is, such as when he makes the seas, and other times he turns it into the land, or the sky. It's awkward to imagine, though, since creating everything out of water doesn't make sense. I suppose this is just a testament to how powerful G-d really is. -Hailey A.</note>
                <note target="#a003" resp="#nc">This description of the universe's basic state being water is interesting given water's chaotic connotations in mythology, such as Poseidon's tempermental moods and the Sumerian gods of the randomly flooding Tigris and Euphrates rivers. In addition, the only way for the universe as we understand it to exist is for a force of great order, such as God, setting boundaries and dividing the chaotic waters to separate the Heavens from the Earth. This understanding lends to the idea of the 6 Days of creation being the first signs of a natural order forming in the universe. -Noah C.</note>
                <note target="#a004" resp="#ji">A contradiction appears here. If the fruit of all trees is food for humans, why is there a restriction on the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge? Most likely however, this contradiction is an artifact from the fact that Genesis 1 and 2 are from seperate scrolls, thus the several differences in the story of creation between the two. -Joshua I.</note>
                <note target="#a005" resp="#nc">Vegetation being described in its usefulness to people is interesting, especially since in Genesis 2:15, God charges mankind with tending to the plants, hinting at a planned, symbiotic relationship between mankind and the crops they plant. In addition, this is a mark of how an agrarian society would understand the vegetation around them. -Noah C.</note>
                <note target="#a006" resp="#ko">In the article <ref target="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/rhetoricraceandreligion/2015/06/charlestonshooting-how-long-white-america-how-long-pt-2.html">"#CharlestonShooting: How Long White America? How Long-Pt. 2,"</ref> the writer challenges white Christian Americans to see African Americans being made in the image of God. The writer makes a good point, as the text never states the race or ethnicity of God, but man was made in "Our image." Noticing the plurality of the word, the writer interprets this as the human race as a whole, not just white people. White Americans can make the country better for Black Americans by imaging the inclusiveness of the creation story of man. All these points can further be stronger by remembering the first Christians were not white, so Christianity is not just for white people. Similiarly, America is not just for white people, it is for everyone. -Kelley O.</note>
                <!-- unedited --><note target="#a007" resp="#ko">The Patheos article titled <ref target="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/rhetoricraceandreligion/2016/08/the-ferguson-declaration-a-black-lives-matter-creed.html">"The #Ferguson Declaration: A Black Lives Matter Creed"</ref> points out this verse in particular to show that God loves everyone equally, and thus "we believe Black Lives Matter." I find this particularly signficicant because even though the movement is reasonably about the awareness of mistreatment of black Americans, man being made in Gods image would make it seem as if we should all look the same, yet we dont and we get treated differently based on our appearance. They state God loves our differences. -Kelley O.</note>

                <note target="#a009" resp="#mm">This statement appears at the end of Genesis 1, and could be significant in how it affects the use of "good" throughout the rest of Genesis 1. Specifically, "good" appears very deliberately throughout Genesis 1 to state what particular items are good. However, there are a few notable exceptions to this that pose an interesting threat, but depending on what this passage is trying to say, this issue may become a non-issue. Individually, is "every thing" that God made good? If so, then these omissions are not significant and there irrelevant. However, is "every thing" on the whole good, in spite of the potential bad that was created? This generates an extremely compelling narrative, fitting in to the notion of potential balance in the world with consideration to good and bad, but it also concretely shows that God created some things that were bad. Why would he do this? Given the importance of language and deliberate use of language throughout Genesis on the whole, this appears to be the case with the omission of "good" from these certain things, and this statement at the end appears to explore if these things that are not necessarily "good" are actually "bad" on the whole. -Mark M.</note>

                    <p>Furthermore, she goes on to talk about how what may be seven days for us, may not be seven days for Him. He had not created the sun or the moon, yet "days" existed. Since the sun is the way we determine our days, it's impossible to really say how long a day was for G-d. It could have been the billions of years the Big Bang Theory states is true.</p>
                    <p>There is also a movie called G-d's not Dead where similar themes are present. A boy tries to convince his college class that G-d exists with actual science. What both of these sources are trying to say is this: science and Genesis can work together if you look to each thing for what it is meant to represent. For the big bang, it is science, and for Genesis, it is religion. -Hailey A.</p></note>
                <note target="#a011" resp="#mm">This text presents a unique expression on how God works. Instead of as in Genesis 1, where God speaks the universe into existence, here it is as if he walks upon the Earth like a man, constructing these creations with his hands. He acts in a very human manner here, almost as if he is a craftsman. On God, this makes him appear with more care and attention to his creation, as a creator concerned with the beauty and art of his craft, just as an artificer or master artisan might be. Yet, there is also the notion that this brings God closer to humans, and humans closer to God. Humans have the ability to create, and must toil with skill and energy to do so, yet they can still create nonetheless. In this sense, they are as God is, crafting the world and breathing life into metal and earth to suit their needs, though admittedly not quite on the level that God is portrayed to have done. -Mark M.</note>

                <note target="#a012" resp="#jp">The translation of this term is consequential for how one understands the tree and also, perhaps, anything that has been labeled "good" thus far in Genesis. Some translators render it just as the first JPS translation has done so here (e.g., Umberto Cassuto (1944), the New Revised Standard Version (1989), and Robert Alter (1996)). Others, such as the JPS 2nd edition (1985) and Robert Sacks (1971) translate the word as "bad." Leon Kass (2003) writes, "The Hebrew word... has a much broader meaning than moral evil" (63). -Jason P.</note>

                <note target="#a015" resp="#mm"><p>From the beginning, Eve is uniquely set apart by the temptation of the Tree of Knowledge, and interestingly created after God's initial warning against eating from the tree. More acutely obvious in Genesis 3 is how Eve takes direct interest in the tree, the only active actor in the scene with the serpent, where Adam is notably absent. This does much to characterize her inherent curiosity, which is instrumental in differentiating the two characters. Adam only does as directed by God, and what is made available to him, where Eve appears to more fundamentally realize her capabilities as a human. Yet she appears to be concerned with things other than gaining knowledge for herself, but perhaps in the potential of humans in the future, taking advantage of their skills of creation and free will.</p>
                    <p>God is often regarded as having created the Tree of Knowledge, which is problematic in itself. If he created the tree, why tempt humanity? What does this add to the experience of living in Eden? Simply put, it is difficult to understand his motivations at this moment, because this leads to him having to apparently punish Adam and Eve when the disobey him. However, there is also the possibility that God did not create the Tree of Knowledge, or the serpent. God appears to be wary of the Tree, and of its inherent danger and apparent corruption. This creates the notion that perhaps he did not create it, as it was not intentional, and as such problematic for him as well as Adam and Eve. The serpent itself provides a unique presence in the Garden, and is often interpreted differently as Satan or a Spirit. Yet, God does appear to be able to exert his will over it, ensuring that it is a being less than divine. Overall, the presence of these things is definitively problematic, and poses an interesting crack in the paradise of Eden. -Mark M.</p></note>

In that class, we wrote essays and one of the ones I wrote was about how G-d is like a casino owner. He's manipulative and very protective of his regulars (the covenant), yet self serving, as I imagine a casino owner would be. He tests and checks his creations to see their constitution, perhaps like a watchful owner would, to ensure there isn't any misconduct going on in the casino. Inevitably, however, something will go wrong, and he starts back at square two (since there are still some humans alive) after the flood because he realises there was some corruption and the games were not going as he had intended. -Hailey A.</note>

Alternatively, does it indicate that the search for knowledge is not necessarily a morally wrong one, just one that God does not want man to search for? Is knowledge sacreligious, or is God simply testing mankind? Is the snake a tool in such a test? These are the questions that can be raised by the existence of evil in a world created by a supposedly all-powerful God. -Noah C.</note>
                <note target="#a020a" resp="#ha">Or it could be that there are multiple deities. There are lots of instances of "us" in creation as well.

                <note target="#a021" resp="#mm">Our first interaction with the being "woman" in Genesis is the prior exchange between the serpent and Eve, and her subsequent disobedience towards God. Simply put, this is a bad foot to start off on for characterizing females as a gender in Genesis, and the blame appears to be lead to Eve practically immediately. Adam is nowhere to be seen during the exchange, and follows complacently with what Eve does, eating the fruit. Moreover, this is the first exhibition of real human independence and an attempt at understanding in Genesis. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a021a" resp="#ha"><p>Mark points out in the previous comment that this is a bad foot to get started on, and I agree. However, I think a different, more pressing question arises from asking "why did Adam let Eve eat the fruit to begin with?"</p>
                    <p>G-d created Eve after He told Adam not to eat from tree, and while she knows she's not supposed to (since she tells the serpent that she knows she will die if she eats from the tree), she may not fully understand the implications if she does eat. "Dying" means nothing to someone if they have never seen it before, and clearly she isn't afraid of it. Adam may understand more, since he existed while G-d was still creating, so he knows His power more than Eve does.</p>
                    <p>But even if she did know that dying wasn't a good thing, why did Adam just stand by and allow her to be "beguiled" by the serpent? He could have stepped in to prohibit the conversation, but he doesn't. He enables Eve to make the decision to eat the fruit. And instead of refusing the fruit, he willingly takes it from Eve's hands and takes a bite. Then Adam has the audacity to tell G-d that Eve forced him to eat the fruit. This doesn't seem right. Especially because Eve inarguable receives a worse punishment than Adam. -Hailey A.</p></note>
                <note target="#a021b" resp="#mm">Basically, what I'm looking for here is a statement on culpability. Is Adam complicit since he didn't say anything?

                <note target="#a023" resp="#nc">Genesis seems to indicate that part of what separates mankind from animals is the recognition that one is naked, seen here as something to be ashamed of that must be resolved before they can be in the presence of God. If Adam and Eve were unashamed of their nakedness prior to eating the fruit of knowledge, then perhaps mankind was no different from other animals aside from being made in the image of God. Does this lead to the conclusion that God is curious, can be ashamed? Is mankind the link between the animalistic nature of beasts and the perfect form of God? -Noah C.</note>
                <note target="#a024" resp="#mm">The idea that God could potentially feel shame definitely makes his later actions, specifically the flood, more interesting. Was he really trying to wipe his regrets away? This could add an angle to his actions that adds depth to his choices. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a024a" resp="#nc">Here, Adam and Eve realized their shame and nakedness, a strange first conclusion after they ate of the Tree of Knowledge. Moreover, they felt shame for it, a development that raises questions after the promise from the serpent that they would become as God(s). Perhaps it is possible that God experienced a far wider breadth of emotion than Adam and Eve did before eating the fruit, making him decidedly human in his perceptions and decisions. If he is susceptible to shame, it follows that he is susceptible to anger, sadness, happiness, and the whole gamut human emotion. Moreover, this conclusion leads us to wonder at the nature of God's choices later on, when he cleanses the Earth of life during the flood, or when he burns Sodom and Gomorrah. Overall, this presents a God intimately concerned with the happenings on Earth, but also a divine entity who is emotional and is affected by these actions. -Noah C.</note>

Moreover, God in this statement suggests that humanity is apparently equal with God on some level, a strange development when it appears they have no chance of exerting their will against him. Perhaps it is that this is the path that sets them onto becoming divine one day, but also it could be that they are only his equal one on level. That is to say, in how they experience life and emotions. They can feel everything in the way that God can, just not on the same scale, and as such there is a division between humans and God. Moreover, God still appears to hold onto vast understanding and power far beyond what humans are able to bring to bear, though in a sense, humans carry a slice of divinity within them in how they create and experience life.

                    <p>Furthermore, since humans now know good and evil, wouldn't they be closer to G-d, now? And isn't that what Eve really wanted to begin with, to be closer to G-d (i.e., to be lifted up to G-d's level). It's also necessary to consider that "know" doesn't always mean "to be familiar with." It can also mean to "have sexual intercourse" and "be capable of," which would have incredible implications about G-d (e.g., does this mean that G-d is also capable of being evil?).</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the comment that Aidan wrote made me think that being fruitful and multiplying is, in a way, immortality, since humanity will be immortal, even if the individual isn't. -Hailey A.</p></note>
                <note target="#a031" resp="#mm">When God offers to let him come clean for his actions or possibly even to lament on what he had done, Cain fails God completely. Abel's murder is an incredibly morally black event that occurs as we understand it, and God reflects this, when he is suitably angry and curses Cain.  God wants to show Cain that what he did was wrong or at least inconvenient for him, and as such is dismayed when he fails the test of his basic loyalty and faith after murdering Abel and ultimately lying to God himself. The other potential explanation is that God did in fact, not know that Cain had killed Abel, or at least had not yet realized it. This means that God is merely a fallible observer with immense power, and colors his actions with genuine concern or interest. He does not know where Abel went, and that troubles him. The revelation that Cain had murdered him is a betrayal of the highest order for God's expectations, and He takes action in accordance with this anger. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a031a" resp="#nc">This is the second time that God has asked a question He already knew the answer to. First in the Garden when looking for Adam and Eve, now in the fields where Cain murdered Abel. God finds how mankind will respond to questions He already knows the answer to interesting, as can be seen when He, immediately after hearing Cain's deflection of His question, accuses and curses Cain for committing murder. -Noah C.</note>
                <note target="#a032" resp="#mm">Cain is allowed to have children after his punishment, these offspring multiplying and prospering to form civilization, associating civilization and Cain intimately with the first instance of fratricide. These cities foster music, art, and culture, but also tools for violence and perpetuates the notion of glory in conflict.

                <note target="#a033" resp="#nc">This line repeats the wording of humanity’s original creation, where God says “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (1.26). Though the likeness and image are switched when Adam begets Seth, it can be inferred that Adam and Eve are channeling God’s creation in making a son, just as Eve says after bearing Cain “I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD” (4.1). The connection between humanity’s propagation and the channeling of God’s divinity indicates a trend towards humanity reaching their own divinity. As such, if man was made in the likeness of God, is the creation of another life a step towards mankind’s divinity? -Noah C.</note>
                <note target="#a033a" resp="#ko">Humans are similar to God here, as they are creating life parallel to how God created them. The difference, though, is that this result of procreation occured after humans ate from the Tree of Knowledge; now they are for certain capable of dying. As far as we know, God is an eternal character, so as much as mankind as individuals would like to act and be like God, they cannot. But the human race can continue to exist as long as God can. Humans can create time-limited individuals. Perhaps this is why in the text, it does not state God begot a son named Adam, while it does say Adam has a son. There is a difference in the significance of their creations, but they are the same in type of creations. -Kelley O.</note>
                <note target="#a034" resp="#mm">Limiting humankind's lifespan is a momentous event that often goes unchecked here, where it is rather important that mankind can no longer live past 120. This means that humans can only accrue so much prestige and ability before invariably dying, their lifespan being concretely limited beyond their control by the divine. This is rather important, since it feeds into the notion that God has a specific idea for what humans should learn in their lives, and that their potential must be limited for one reason or another. This hard limit on human life is also indicative that God wants mankind to develop more slowly, possibly because he feels that humans need to learn certain things before pushing forward harder in both age and knowledge. Essentially, it appears that He wants to limit the ascension of mankind for a time. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a035" resp="#mm">Here, humankind is displayed as potentially inherently evil, but to build on that notion, that God does not control whether or not we are good or evil. Instead, it appears that this is created of our own free will, as God observes in rapt fascination, or maybe even horror. Either way, he deems this development as highly questionable and even condemnable, and as a result prepares to flood the Earth. Ultimately, God has an aversion to evil, but the reasoning behind this is undeniably ambiguous. Does he prefer no evil so that humankind is given a more substantial opportunity to live longer? Or is the situation one of personal disdain for the evil? -Mark M.</note>

This stands apart from the ideas on forgiveness or education in Genesis, where God instead of doing either of these purges the entirety of the globe save for Noah, a bizarre turn of events that is highly violent and indiscriminate. God minimizes the variables, focusing only on Noah, who has certain expectations for and believes in, making Noah what God expects to be the ideal human to keep alive. -Mark M.</note>

                <note target="#a039" resp="#mm">God is notably and exceptionally concerned for the corruption of mankind, especially with violence. This concern for violence appears to be a core tenet of God's philosophy, starting as far back as Cain murdering Abel, this notion of violence carries on until now. God appears to abhor violence, only resorting to it when absolutely necessary, or simply finds it to be incredibly inconvenient to what happens under his watch on Earth. Regardless, in some measure it is clear that these issues are directly contrary to what God would want to see. He floods the Earth because of this, a strong implication of an emotional attachment to what is occurring indicated when his hand is forced and he tires of such violence. -Mark M.</note>

God gives Noah a mandate on how to leave, and he disobeys it, relegating his wife to a position behind his son. This could be indicative a bias that God is not subject to- after all, he put Noah's wife before Noah's sons, suggesting a hierachy. The Patriach, followed by the Matriarch, then the offspring and their wives, repeating the formula of husband to wife. However, Noah elevates his sons, even in spite of God's own orders, putting his sons before his wife. This could be indicative of merely preferring to attend to his sons, but perhaps more significantly, associates Noah with subjugating women beneath men. -Mark M.</note>

                    <p>The first time He says it to Adam and Eve, it's important, but, except for Noah, G-d destroys all their progeny  because they were corrupt, so their fruitfulness and multiplication was for naught. -Hailey A.</p></note>

At times, this scene is characterized as God lamenting over his prior actions, and ensuring that he never will do such a thing again. Given the earlier discussion on God feeling the full range of human emotions, as implied by humans eating from the Tree of Knowledge, we see an interesting situation here where God is potentially wracked with regret in this instance. Apparently, God can make mistakes, and this is instrumental in understanding his at times confusing relationship with mankind.

                <note target="#a045" resp="#mm">This quotation is saying that God made man in his image, yet in context, as it relates to the Covenant, implies that this image alone is enough to associate mankind with divinity and thereby grant them a significant measure of dominion over the rest of the world. The mere visage of God is enough to grant humans the right to rule under the Covenant, and they are God's chosen. When mankind was created, they were allowed this degree of divinity by God himself, and this divinity is exercised through humans creating. However, this creation is exercised by humans as relating to the divine, but not necessarily an extension. With toledot, or generations, there is a theme of humanity continuing its lineage. This is mandated by God, and while it is in certain measure humans exercising their ability of creation, it is more intimately related with further mankind under God's own word. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a046" resp="#as">The motivations for building this great city are shown to be in direct opposition to the charge G-d gives so many times to all Life and specifically to Man several times. -Aidan S.</note>
                <note target="#a047" resp="#mm">In this instance, another situation of dubious forgiveness in Genesis under God is demonstrated. God does not give the humans an opportunity to learn or change here, but scatters them without warning and confounds their language so they may not communicate. In a sense, this is a total condemnation of cooperation for quite some time to come, putting an innate barrier between all of these different language and developing peoples. However, this may fit into the notion that God wants humanity to learn- in this case, how to cooperate in the face of exceptional adversity insofar as they may not be able to speak the language. It is equally possible or even likely that this was done simply to see what mankind would do if God put one of its greatest obstacles yet in the way, the language barrier. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a048" resp="#ha">Why aren't Sarai's parents mentioned at all? It seems like everyone else in Genesis always has who they are related to mentioned but not Sarai? That is really odd because Sarai, compared to Milcah, is way more important to the story. -Hailey A.</note>
                <note target="#a049" resp="#mm">Here, God intentionally limits the heights that mankind can reach. This is one of the instances where God's reasoning for this is entirely ambiguous, however, one might infer that this is because humanity simply is not ready yet. Mankind requires the limitations to grow and understand the world around them, instead of aspiring to these heights and building a tower to Heaven before their time. In a sense, they tried to reach the conclusion before they went through the body of their experience. God wants humanity to be better before they ascend, but through what measure, this is unclear. -Mark M.</note>
                <note target="#a050" resp="#ko">In these genealogy monologues, they always say “[father’s name] begot sons and daughters.” Clearly, females are being born and later used to create the next generation biologically. Even though women evidently exist in the book of Genesis, why do daughters ever receive the covenant from God or their fathers? -Kelley O.</note>
                <note target="#a050a" resp="#ha"><p>In reference to the previous comment, our feminist glasses should be put on here. We've been trying to read Genesis, keeping our eyes peeled and supplementing our knowledge with more info on how women are written and treated in Genesis.</p>
                    <p>It's true that women don't have the covenant, but it's untrue that there aren't important women. There is Sarah, Hagar, Rebecca, Leia and Rachel. But they don't have G-d's protection or promise. -Hailey A.</p></note>
